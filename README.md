# Humpback-Whale-Identification (kaggle competition)

Marin Piotte's notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/martinpiotte/whale-recognition-model-with-score-0-78563#) was the base from which I created the code. It was my first naive try to experience a Kaggle competition.

### Challenge

The challenge is to build an algorithm to identify individual whales in images. 

Training example:

### Model  

The model is a Siamese Neural Network tasked with predicting whether two images depict the same or different whale. Final model score (Mean Average Precision) went from 0.78 to 0.85 (1.0 is the maximum).
